# Java-Password-Generator

## Description

Ever have a problem figuring out what password to use? With many websites requiring a password of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numerical values, and special characters I built a random password generator that creates a password based on user prompts. This was my first javascript project that helped solidify my knowledge of arrays as well as loops.
